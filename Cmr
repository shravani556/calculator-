TLS upgrade to TLS 1.2 for QA storage accounts to meet security and compliance requirements.

Update TLS setting to 1.2 in Azure Portal for the three storage accounts and validate connectivity.

No downtime expected. Minimal risk. Possible impact only if any legacy client still uses TLS 1.0/1.1.

Revert TLS version to previous setting in Azure Portal if issues occur.

Verify read/write access and confirm application connectivity after the change.
