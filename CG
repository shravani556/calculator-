If you want, I can also:

- Add a rollback/backout note
- Align wording exactly with ServiceNow risk section
- Make it very concise (2–3 lines)Here’s how you can remediate the APIM issue (authenticate API endpoints) via the Azure Portal steps + Terraform code + official Microsoft docs links.
✅ 1) Portal Steps – Enforce Authentication
A) Subscription Key (Basic)
Go to API Management instance in Azure Portal.
Open APIs → Select your API.
On Settings, enable Require subscription key.
Save & test calls with valid key.
Subscription key enforcement ensures clients must send a valid APIM subscription key. This is basic auth.�
Microsoft Learn
B) OAuth2 / JWT Validation
To require bearer token validation:
Go to API Management instance → APIs.
Select API (or Operation) → Design.
Click Inbound processing → Add policy.
Choose Validate JWT or Validate Microsoft Entra token.
Fill:
Issuer / Audience
Header = Authorization
OpenID config URL
Save policy.
💡 You can validate an access token from Microsoft Entra ID / OAuth2 provider.�
Microsoft Learn +1
Documentation Link (Validate JWT policy):
👉 https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy �
Microsoft Learn
C) Mutual TLS (Client Certificate Validation)
To require mTLS (certificate from client):
In APIM instance, go to Security → Certificates.
Upload certificate (or configure Key Vault certificate).
Edit API → Inbound processing → Add policy:
Copy code
Xml
<validate-client-certificate>
    <identities>
        <identity thumbprint="THUMBPRINT_OF_CERT"/>
    </identities>
</validate-client-certificate>
Save & test.
Docs (client certificate validation):
👉 https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/validate-client-certificate-policy �
Microsoft Learn
✅ 2) Terraform Approach
A) API JWT Policy in Terraform
Use azurerm_api_management_api_operation_policy to set policy XML:
Copy code
Hcl
resource "azurerm_api_management_api_operation_policy" "jwt_policy" {
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  api_management_name  = azurerm_api_management.apim.name
  api_name             = azurerm_api_management_api.example.name
  operation_id         = "get"  # operation id
  xml_content = <<-XML
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" require-scheme="Bearer">
          <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
          <audiences>
            <audience><CLIENT_ID_OR_API_ID_URI></audience>
          </audiences>
        </validate-jwt>
      </inbound>
      <backend>
        <base />
      </backend>
      <outbound>
        <base />
      </outbound>
    </policies>
  XML
}
✔ This will enforce JWT on API operation. �
Terraform Registry
B) Client Certificate (mTLS) in Terraform
Terraform doesn’t have a direct “validate-client-cert” resource so you embed into policy:
Copy code
Hcl
resource "azurerm_api_management_api_operation_policy" "cert_policy" {
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  api_management_name  = azurerm_api_management.apim.name
  api_name             = azurerm_api_management_api.example.name
  operation_id         = "post"
  
  xml_content = <<-XML
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <validate-client-certificate>
          <identities>
            <identity thumbprint="YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT"/>
          </identities>
        </validate-client-certificate>
      </inbound>
      <backend><base /></backend>
      <outbound><base /></outbound>
    </policies>
  XML
}
You must upload the client certificate to APIM or use Key Vault and reference it. �

1) Machines should have secrets findings resolved

Remediate (Portal)

Go to Microsoft Defender for Cloud → Recommendations.

Open “Machines should have secrets findings resolved”.

Review Affected resources and open a Finding to see the secret details.

Expand and follow the Remediation steps shown in the recommendation.

Rotate/revoke the exposed secret at its source (password/key/token), then remove it from the machine (delete plaintext files/env vars/configs).

Re-check until the resource is Healthy. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Microsoft docs

Remediate secrets findings: 
Microsoft Learn

2) Windows servers should be configured to use secure communication protocols

This typically means disabling legacy SSL/TLS (like SSL 2.0/3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1) and ensuring modern TLS (TLS 1.2+) is enabled/used via Schannel settings on Windows. 
Microsoft Learn

Remediate (common approach in Azure environments)

Ensure the VM can be assessed/configured via Azure’s OS baseline tooling by installing the Azure Machine Configuration (guest configuration) extension and enabling a system-assigned managed identity on the VM. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Configure Windows TLS/SSL (Schannel) protocol registry settings to disable legacy protocols and enable TLS 1.2 (and TLS 1.3 where applicable) using Microsoft’s supported registry guidance. 
Microsoft Learn

Reboot if required, then validate application compatibility (important for older clients/services).

Re-check compliance in the originating control (Defender for Cloud/Azure Policy/Azure Advisor) after the next evaluation cycle.

Microsoft docs

TLS registry settings (Schannel): 
Microsoft Learn

Machine Configuration extension (guest configuration):

3) Azure running container images should have vulnerabilities resolved

Remediate (Portal / Kubernetes runtime images)

In Defender for Cloud → Recommendations, open the container image vulnerability recommendation.

Select the affected Kubernetes cluster, then a container to view vulnerabilities.

For each vulnerability, follow remediation guidance and:

Build a new image with patched package versions,

Push the updated image,

Replace workloads to use the new image (tag/digest),

Retire/remove the old vulnerable image where practical.

Re-check the recommendation until Healthy (results can take time to refresh).

4) FTPS should be required in Function Apps

Remediate (Portal)

Open the Function App in the Azure portal.

Go to Settings → Configuration → General settings.

Under Platform settings, set FTP state = “FTPS only” (or Disabled if you don’t use FTP/FTPS deployment).

If using FTPS only, ensure Minimum Inbound TLS is TLS 1.2+ (TLS 1.0/1.1 aren’t supported for FTPS only).

Save.

5) API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated

Defender for Cloud flags APIs where no authentication mechanisms are enforced. It assesses authentication by checking for subscription keys (when subscription is required) and/or policies validating JWT, client certificates, or Microsoft Entra tokens. 
Microsoft Learn

Remediate (typical patterns)

Subscription key enforcement

Require subscriptions for your API/product and ensure callers use valid subscription keys. 
Microsoft Learn

Token-based authentication (Microsoft Entra / OAuth2 / OIDC)

Apply validate-jwt at the API or operation scope to require a valid bearer token. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Mutual TLS / client certificate authentication

Configure APIM to require/validate client certificates (mTLS) and validate them using policy. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Re-test calls and re-check Defender for Cloud until remediated.

6) Authentication should be enabled on API endpoints hosted in Function Apps

A strong baseline remediation is enabling App Service Authentication/Authorization (Easy Auth) for the Function App and setting unauthenticated behavior to require authentication. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Remediate (Portal)

Open the Function App.

Go to Settings → Authentication.

Enable authentication and Add identity provider (commonly Microsoft Entra).

Set Action to take when request is not authenticated to sign in / require authentication (block anonymous requests unless explicitly allowed). 
Microsoft Learn

Validate endpoint behavior (401/redirect as expected) and re-check the alert.

Microsoft docs

Easy Auth (App Service + Functions) and “require authentication” behavior: 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Configure Microsoft Entra sign-in for Functions/App Service: 
Microsoft Learn

Securing Azure Functions (secure HTTP endpoints guidance): 
Microsoft Learn

7) SQL databases should have vulnerability findings resolved

Remediate

Ensure SQL vulnerability assessment is enabled (Express config is commonly used and can be enabled per DB/resource if needed). 
Microsoft Learn

From the DB’s Defender for Cloud page, open Vulnerability Assessment, view findings, and run an on-demand scan if required. 
Microsoft Learn

Open each failed finding to see impact and apply the recommended fix.

If a finding is acceptable for your environment, mark it as a baseline so it stops reporting as a failure. 
Microsoft Learn

Re-scan and confirm the recommendation becomes Healthy.

Azure SQL Database Snapshots - Official Microsoft Documentation

📚 Official Microsoft Documentation Links:

1. Database Snapshots (SQL Server Feature):

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-snapshots-sql-server

This covers traditional SQL Server database snapshots (on-premises & SQL Server on VMs)

2. Azure SQL Database - Manual Backups (Equivalent to Snapshots):

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-overview#manual-backups

3. Database Copy (Similar to Snapshot Functionality):

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/database-copy

---

🔍 Azure SQL Database "Snapshot" Reality:

For Azure SQL Database:

· ❌ No traditional "snapshot" feature like VM snapshots
· ✅ Equivalent functionality through:
  · Database Copy (point-in-time copy)
  · Manual exports (bacpac files)
  · Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)

Available "Snapshot-like" Options:

Method Similar to Snapshot Retention Cost
Database Copy ✅ Yes Until deleted Additional database cost
Export to bacpac ✅ Yes Storage cost only Storage cost
PITR to new database ✅ Yes Until deleted Additional database cost

---

🔄 Snapshot vs Azure SQL Database Options:

Feature Traditional Snapshot Azure SQL Database Equivalent
Instant creation ✅ Yes ⚠️ Fast (seconds to minutes)
Point-in-time ✅ Yes ✅ Yes (PITR)
Zero storage overhead ✅ Yes (differential) ❌ No (full copy)
Automated ✅ Yes ✅ Yes (PITR)
Manual on-demand ✅ Yes ✅ Yes (Database Copy)

---

🎯 How to Create "Snapshots" in Azure SQL Database:

Method 1: Database Copy (Recommended)

```sql
-- Creates an exact copy at current point in time
CREATE DATABASE database_copy AS COPY OF original_database;
```

Method 2: Export to bacpac

· Use Azure Portal → Export feature
· Creates downloadable bacpac file
· Stores in Azure Storage

Method 3: Point-in-Time Restore

· Restore to any point within retention period
· Creates new database from backup

---

📊 Snapshot Capability Summary:

Resource Type Snapshot Capable Snapshot Method Official Documentation
Azure SQL Database ⚠️ Partial Database Copy, Export https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/database-copy
Virtual Machines ✅ Yes VM Snapshots https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/snapshots
Storage Accounts ✅ Yes Blob Snapshots https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/snapshots-overview
App Services ❌ No Manual Backups https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-backup

---

🚨 Important Note:

"Azure SQL Database doesn't have traditional snapshots like VMs or storage. Instead, use Database Copy for immediate point-in-time copies or rely on the built-in PITR for recovery to any point within your retention period."

Your database a00003-arstaging-prd can use Database Copy for snapshot-like functionality, but it will incur additional costs for the copied database.

Subject: Request for Confirmation – Decommission or Region Migration for Sandbox Resources (West Central US)

Hi Bryan,

Hope you are doing well.

As part of the Jira task MSAZ-11454, I have reviewed the resources currently present in the Sandbox subscription under the West Central US region.
Below are the resources that are still active in this region:

Default Log Analytics Workspace

Network Watcher

Security Center–related solutions

SQL Advanced Threat Protection

SQL Vulnerability Assessment

Storage account (strguv01)

Other default security/monitoring components


All these resources are located in West Central US, and as per the analysis, there is no dependency to migrate them to another region, unless required by the subscription owner.

Before proceeding further, I would like to request your confirmation on one of the following actions:

1. Decommission these resources from the Sandbox environment
OR


2. Proceed with region migration to a standard region (if decommission is not approved)



Kindly confirm your preferred approach so we can proceed accordingly.
I have copied Kash for visibility.

Please let me know if you need any more details.

Thanks & Regards,
Sravani B
