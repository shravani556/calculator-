Here is a clean, professional comment you can post explaining the delay and what you checked.
Keep it short, clear, and technical — managers love that.

✅ Suggested Comment to Update

Update:
During the deployment we faced a few verification steps, which caused the delay.
I reviewed the Terraform module inputs and confirmed the following:

imageDefault / ImagDefault is not being passed from anywhere.

The VM image is controlled via os_distribution = "win2019" in locals.tf.

Patch mode is coming from the module's default value (TF Registry).

No unexpected overrides or default image changes were found.


Deployment can proceed safely with the current configuration.

If you want a shorter version:

✅ Short version

Checked module inputs — no imageDefault passed.
OS image is explicitly defined as win2019.
Patch mode is coming from default module settings.
Everything is validated; ready to proceed.


---

If you want a more detailed version:

✅ Detailed version

Verified module variables and locals.

Confirmed no references to imageDefault or overriding image parameters.

OS image configuration is explicitly defined in the VM config block.

Patch mode is managed by the Terraform private module and updated via registry defaults.

No conflicts or unexpected parameter overrides were identified.
